 * The EditorKit provides a connection between
 * some kind of "ontology model" (or knowledgebase) and
 * a UI for that model/knowledgebase.  The model, whatever
 * it might be is managed by a <code>ModelManager</code>.  The
 * UI comes in the form of a <code>Workspace</code>.

 * Each <code>Workspace</code> has a reference to its
 * <code>EditorKit</code>, and each <code>ModelManager</code>
 * has a reference to its <code>EditorKit</code>.

 * Each <code>EditorKit</code> has an ID, which determines its
 * type.  This is used by views, and other plugins such as menu
 * items that are only applicable to certain types of <code>EditorKit</code>s.
 * For example, an <code>OWLReasoner</code> can only work with an
 * <code>OWLEditorKit</code>.
