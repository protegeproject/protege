<h3>Version info</h3>

<h4>v4.1.0 Update Build 220 - 24 Mar, 2011</h4>

<ul> 
<li> Added the ability to change the version IRI of an ontology.</li>
<li> Stopped the repeated exceptions that occur when a reasoner
  detects an inconsistent ontology.</li>
<li> Fixed a problem where a bad choice of the look and feel could
     prevent Prot&#x00E9g&#x00E9 from starting up.</li>
<li> Fixed a refresh problem in the property hierarchy panels where deleting
    a property did not remove it from the property hierarchy.</li>
<li> Fixed a bug where dragging a class in the class hierarchy to its
    own superclass would 
    remove the class from the tree. </li>
<li> In some cases, ontologies on the web would be slow to load
     because Protege did make good use of content negotiation. This
     has been fixed.</li>
<li>Imports are not automatically redirected to the users disk if the
    choice of file to choose for the import is ambiguous. </li>
<li> Fixed some incompatibilities involving how different copies of
    identical axioms are displayed.  An axiom can appear more than
    once in an ontology if it is imported from different locations or
    if the two copies of the same axiom have different annotations.</li>
</ul>
