<h3>Version info</h3>

<h4>v4.1.0 Update Build 209 - 12 Oct, 2010</h4>

This is the version of the OWL editor that is needed in order to
update to the latest version of the dlquery plugin.

<ul>
<li>A fix for the problem where moving/copying axioms by reference
  lost annotation assertion axioms.  See GForge 2674.</li>
<li>Some user interface modifications for working with the reasoner.</li>
</ul>

<h4>v4.1.0 Update Build 209 - 10 Oct, 2010</h4>

The most significant change for this update was the improvement of the
export inferred ontologies action.  It is recommended that anyone who
is exporting the inferred ontology will upgrade to this version.
There have been other changes to the user interface but some of these
are still under discussion at Stanford.

<ul>
<li> Fixed some problems in the export inferred ontologies action.  I
    now can export annotations and it ensures that the reasoner is
    properly initialized for the tasks that it performs during the
    export task. Also the export of disjoint classes was substantially
    improved.
<li> Clarified the role of different reasoner preferences panels.  By
    default a user only needs to specify what inferences he wants
    displayed and the preferences for how the reasoner is initialized
    will be automatically adjusted.</li>
<li> Provided the ability to modify the way in which ontologies are
    imported (e.g. ontology libraries) through the Prot&#x00E9g&#x00E9
    user interface.</li>
<li> The search for imports in a folder can now be done recursively if
    the user desires (and this is the default).</li>
</ul>
