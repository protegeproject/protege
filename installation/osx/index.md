Installing Protégé on Mac OS X
==============================

Protege {{site.version}} is distributed in the form of a Mac OS X Application.  This includes the 64-bit Java Runtime Environment (JRE).  The application is contained within a ZIP file.

1. Go to the [download page](http://protege.stanford.edu/software.php#desktop-protege) and click the Download button. Alternatively, go to the [release page](https://github.com/protegeproject/protege-distribution/releases/tag/protege-{{site.version}}) on GitHub and download the ```Protege-{{site.version}}-mac.zip``` file.
2. Once the download completes, navigate to the folder where Protégé was downloaded to. This will typically be your "Downloads" folder.
